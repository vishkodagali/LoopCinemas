ChatGPT
In the month of August 2023, I used the Default (GPT-3.5)  of OpenAI's ChatGPT to perform background research by using the following prompts (in general):

Some doubts I had regaring integration of css with the react components
Requesting help to get through an issue I was facing for showing edit prompts for a user review.
Debugging errors where the app was deleting content in local storage repeatedly.
Helping to correct some incorrect logic on showing the modal to leave a review
